# 🎣 AntiPhish

*Firefox extension providing anti-phishing measures.*

## Features

* Adds a warning ⚠️ emoji to Unicode links.
* Adds a confirmation dialog when clicking Unicode links.

## Background

I got the idea for this extension after reading 
[Phishing with Unicode Domains](https://www.xudongz.com/blog/2017/idn-phishing/)
by Xudong Zheng.

## Outlook

I want to add more features to prevent phishing.
If you know common phishing patterns that can be detected automatically, feel free to open an issue 😊.
